# The Mystical AI Mirror

*I conceptualized this idea in March 2024 after viewing a [Computational Mama](https://computationalmama.xyz/projects/)'s Mothers exhibit at BIC. However, I was not capable enough back then to get this working but you can see my current work in progress [here](identity-crisis-production-3471.up.railway.app)*

Growing up on the early Web2.0 years had us uploading every part of our lives online in a curated manner. Orkut, Picasa, Flickr, Facebook, Snap.. all products that I've used (and still do) to host my images. However with the age of the LLM training upon us, many of these images have (or eventually will be) been used to train models without our consent. I believe it was a few months ago when I had a look at [Exposing.ai](https://exposing.ai/search/) and found some of my Flickr photos in the MegaFace database. 

It felt odd. 

Eventhough as a digital native, I knew this was inevitable, this still felt like a crossing of boundaries. It made me feel helpless.

We adopted Midjourney at work. I was apprehensive at first about using it. Even with the [multi-fingered hand](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Why-does-AI-art-screw-up-hands-and-fingers-2230501) era of image generation was behind us, working with image gen was still new and prone to errors.

'Prompt Engineering' was gaining popularity and there were many sites and influencers building audiences to help new users to image gen navigate the space. I started playing around with Midjourney around the time it came up with the web interface and it helped me see it's use from a commercial point of view. Even with our efforts on ground, taking images, and videos, we were often at loss when it comes to having enough stock images to help us with our marketing efforts. Midjourney was able to help us generate more images that helped us connect to our target audience and build our brand. 

AI wasn't stealing any jobs here. It was supplementing our efforts and helping us produce more. It made me feel hopeful.

Slowly the real world started filling up with more and more AI images. Neither Gods nor Politicians were spared. Whatsapp forwards breached new levels of mis-information. But the average person was still unaware of this technology shift. AI was getting good. But I wondered how would people feel about what it knows about us. Would you feel represented in this new Age or have you been left out as the AI juggernaut pushes ahead?

This project attempts to show you what the LLM knows about you and tracks what do you feel about it. We want to collect anonymized data about the images generated and visualize the relationships between the users and the generated images.
